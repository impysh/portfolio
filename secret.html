<p>Hi, I'm Izza Natalia, a final-year Computer Engineering student at SP with a strong foundation in web and app development, data analytics, and UX/UI design. During my internship at Sembcorp, I worked with solar energy data, leveraging my coding skills to build visualizations and enhance data-driven insights. Beyond technical expertise, I bring a creative edge to problem-solving, ensuring both functionality and great user experiences. I'm eager to merge my passion for technology and design in this role while continuously expanding my skills. Excited for the opportunityâ€”thank you!</p>
